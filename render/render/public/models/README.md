## Getting a T-Shirt Model

You can:

1. **Download from free 3D model sites:**
   - Sketchfab (search for "t-shirt" with GLB/GLTF format)
   - Poly Haven
   - Free3D

2. **Create your own:**
   - Use Blender to create a simple t-shirt mesh
   - Export as GLB format

3. **Use a placeholder:**
   - The app includes a fallback cube that will be colored if no model is found

## Model Requirements

- Format: `.glb` (preferred) or `.gltf`
- Size: Keep under 5MB for web performance
- Materials: Should have a material that can be colored (the app will modify the material color)

For now, the app will show a colored cube placeholder until you add a real t-shirt model.
